I am a PhD student in Computer Science at Indiana University Indianapolis, focusing on cryptography, privacy, and trust-minimized computation. My research explores how Secure Multiparty Computation (SMPC) and post-quantum cryptography can be applied to enable secure collaboration and data sharing in decentralized and federated environments.

Before starting my PhD, I gained professional experience at Venture23, Sireto Technology, and Nethermind, working across blockchain ecosystems and applied cryptography. My broader goal is to design protocols and systems that preserve privacy while remaining practical and efficient for real-world deployment.
